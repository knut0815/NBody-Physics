This engine allows the user to input thousands of objects and watch an n-body physics display occur. If objects collide, those objects will "merge".

The number at the top right represents the number of objects remaining in the simulation.

The camera "locks-on" to the largest mass object and follows it around, moving to any larger object as objects merge.

It relies on only a few functions and objects to do all the work, so hopefully the code is quite easy to understand and follow.

The camera can be zoomed in and out using 'A' and 'Z' respectively.

Please let me know how I could improve this!
